This file contains essential DOs and DONTs for the agent. Must be followed, non negotiable.

DOs

- In case of errors (especially type errors) that you don't understand or that you think shouldn't be happening, ALWAYS GOOGLE SEARCH TO CHECK THE DOCS FOR THE RELEVANT PACKAGE TO SEE WHETEHR THE SETUP IS CORRECT OR NOT OR WHY IT'S HAPPENING. Do NOT go digging through node modules yourself.
- Bun is the configured runtime, not npm, so always use bun for every command.
- Always run a type check once you're done making all the changes you were ordered to in order to make sure that there's no unused/incorrect imports or other type errors.

DONTs

- Do not fix an issue that was not the result of your code and do not go messing around with code you were not explicitly ordered to modify without the user's permission. In case you find an error or see a problem, always talk to the user about it first. Do not go solving these things on your own.
